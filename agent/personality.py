"""
Personality flavor prefixes for free-form chat and Agent Collab modes.

These short prefixes influence ONLY tone/style — never reasoning depth,
output structure, tool calling, or JSON formats.

Applied in two places only:
  1. Free-form chat (no preset_intent, chatbox_mode=True)
  2. Agent Collab mode (reasoning_model="agent_collab")

All other preset/agent modes get NO personality prefix.
