FLVS Procurement Meeting Script
1. Opening: Reset the Frame (30 seconds)
“Thanks for making the time. I’m still getting up to speed on the account, so my goal today is just to understand how FLVS is using Postman right now, share a few usage insights I pulled, and see if there’s an opportunity to streamline things before your 12/11 renewal.”
You sound calm, in control, and not over-eager.

2. Share Only the Most Strategic Data (1–2 min)
Not a data dump. Procurement hates data dumps. They love signals.
“Here’s what I’m seeing at a high level:
	• You have 129 total users, with 54 active this month.
	• 55 paid users are on a single Basic team.
	• You also have 17 separate Free teams with 24 users scattered across them.
	• There are 12 team workspaces and 56 collections that are 90+ days old.
	• And right now you’re renewing by credit card, which is usually a sign the org hasn’t centralized Postman yet.”
Then stop. Let the silence do the heavy lifting.

3. Strategic Discovery (2–4 min)
You’re not interrogating. You’re aligning.
Ask casually:
	• “Do you have visibility into all these Free teams and how they’re using Postman?”
	• “Do you know if any of the engineering or QA groups are using this independently?”
	• “Is tool consolidation or cleaning up sprawl something your IT or procurement org is focusing on this year?”
	• “Is the plan at renewal to keep the current setup as-is, or would FLVS prefer something more centralized and predictable?”
These questions let them say “yeah, this is a mess.”

4. Validate Your Assumptions (1–2 min)
You’re not telling them they have a problem — you’re checking.
“My assumption is that the mix of Basic, Free teams and credit card renewal means Postman has grown organically across FLVS. Usually when we see this pattern, there’s an opportunity to pull everything under one contract, clean up access, and give procurement better visibility and predictability. Does that line up with what you’re seeing internally?”
If they say “yes,” the door is open.
If they say “no,” they’ll explain the real situation, which is just as valuable.

5. Introduce Enterprise Without ‘Pitching’ (2–3 min)
Keep it cool and benefit-driven. Procurement only cares about:
	• Predictability
	• Consolidation
	• Risk reduction
	• Easier renewals
	• Eliminating chaos
“Given the usage patterns, the centralized teams at FLVS may be at the point where an Enterprise structure would actually simplify things. Instead of multiple scattered accounts and credit cards, you’d have one contract, consolidated billing, cleaner access control, and full visibility into who’s doing what.”
You’re not saying “buy Enterprise.”
You’re saying “this is the cleanest version of your world.”

6. Close for Technical Alignment (1 min)
Your close is not the upgrade. It’s the next meeting.
“The next step would be looping in whoever owns your API work — engineering, QA, dev leads — so I can validate whether consolidation actually benefits them. Can you point me toward who should be part of that conversation?”
This is the move procurement loves, because:
	• You’re not forcing a decision
	• You’re involving the right departments
	• You’re moving the deal forward without pressure

Tone Guidance (Because You Asked)
	• Keep it low-key. You’re reviewing a file, not pitching.
	• No apologizing. No “sorry I’m new,” no “I don’t want to take too much time.”
	• Slow pacing = confidence.
	• Short sentences.
	• Let them talk. The more they talk, the better your upgrade chances.
	• Be the calm operator. Procurement likes calm operators.

Why This Works for FLVS Specifically
	• 17 Free teams = procurement nightmare
	• 24 ungoverned users = risk
	• 55 paid users on Basic = likely underpowered
	• 12 workspaces = potential sprawl
	• CC billing = no oversight
	• 56 old collections = nobody’s actually managing this
	• Renewal date is close = they’ll want predictability
This combo is the exact profile of a customer ready to consolidate.
