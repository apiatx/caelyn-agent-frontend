You are the frontend implementation agent for HippoAI. Goal: redesign the homepage UI to feel like a Bloomberg Terminal workspace, while preserving 100% of existing prompts and functionality. Do not delete or rename any prompt. Only reorganize, restyle, and improve interaction patterns.

PRIMARY OUTCOME
Convert the current prompt-button wall into a terminal-style layout with:
1) Top Command Bar (global run input)
2) Left Rail Navigator (all prompts grouped + searchable)
3) Main Workspace (dockable/resizable panels for results)
4) Right Sidebar (persistent context + filters)
5) Bottom Ticker Tape (headlines/movers/sentiment)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Keep every prompt and its exact underlying action intact.
- No loss of functionality: prompt buttons, natural language chat, screening, analysis output, multi-source reasoning.
- Existing backend calls remain unchanged where possible. Refactor only UI layer and state wiring.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness but prioritize desktop terminal experience.
- No large “ChatGPT chat” center column. Chat becomes a panel/module, not the entire product.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
A) Top Command Bar (sticky):
- Input supports natural language queries and explicit commands.
- Support commands: /scan /analyze /news /sentiment /macro /watch
- Enter runs query using existing backend endpoint.
- Shift+Enter queues query (store in state as pending run).
- Show small inline toggles: timeframe, universe, risk mode, sources.

B) Left Rail Navigator:
- Collapsible groups: All-Encompassing, Sectors, Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, Buzz.
- Each existing prompt becomes a compact list item, not a large pill button.
- Add a prompt search input at top filtering prompt items in real time.
- Clicking a prompt triggers its existing action and renders results to Main Workspace panels.

C) Main Workspace Panels:
- Implement a panel system: grid layout with resizable panels.
- Default panels: Results Table, Insight Summary, News, Sentiment, Macro, Chart Snapshot, Chat.
- Each run updates appropriate panels based on the action type.
- Panels have header controls: pin, close, popout, refresh, copy.
- Preserve the current response content, but render it inside panels with structured sections and tables.

D) Right Sidebar:
- Persistent filters and context that apply across runs:
  - Active symbols, watchlist, sector, market cap range, liquidity filter
  - Regime indicator and source toggles
- Store in global state and apply to queries sent to backend as metadata when available.

E) Bottom Ticker Tape:
- Compact scrolling strip that displays:
  - breaking headlines
  - top movers
  - sentiment spikes
  - upcoming catalysts
- Pull from existing data sources if available; otherwise show placeholders with hook points.

DESIGN SYSTEM (Terminal look)
- Use compact spacing and subtle borders.
- Use mono or mono-like font for tickers/numbers.
- Replace large rounded pills with squared or lightly rounded controls.
- Prioritize tables first, narrative second.
- Keep color minimal: use one accent color for highlights only.

STATE + DATA FLOW
- Create a Prompt Registry: a single data structure listing every prompt with id, group, label, icon, action handler.
- Actions route to a unified “runCommand” function that calls existing backend.
- Results normalized into a “panelData” store keyed by panel type.
- Keep chat as one panel that can also run commands and update panels.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Every prompt visible in the left rail and runnable.
- Command bar can run the same actions as prompts using natural language.
- Results appear in panels, not as a chat-first feed.
- No regressions in backend integration.
- UI feels dense, fast, and terminal-like on desktop.

DELIVERABLES
1) New page layout implementation
2) Prompt Registry + left rail rendering
3) Command bar + command palette
4) Panel system with at least 6 default panels + chat panel
5) Persistent sidebar filters wired into runCommand metadata
6) Ticker tape component with data hook points

Implement in React with clean components and minimal rework of existing API calls.
