FRONTEND FEATURE: Pretty renderer for Trending Now (cross_asset_trending)

Goal:
Render display_type = "cross_asset_trending" as a rich panel like daily_briefing.
Do not change the payload contract. Do not change the button mapping.
Backend already returns { type, analysis, structured }. Use structured.

A) Add a new panel renderer
In the panel rendering switch/case (where daily_briefing is rendered), add:
case "cross_asset_trending": render a CrossAssetTrendingPanel using data.structured

B) Layout requirements (match Daily Briefing vibe)
Panel sections in this order:

1) Header strip
- Title: "Trending Now"
- Regime badge (if present): structured.meta.regime or structured.market_pulse.regime
- As-of time (structured.as_of or structured.meta.as_of_utc)

2) Social Trading Signal card (the hero)
Use structured.social_trading_signal object:
- Left: symbol + asset_class + classification pill (TRADE IDEA or WATCHLIST)
- Right: Rating pill + Confidence number
- Middle: Thesis bullets (2-4)
- Confirmation grid: TA / Volume / Catalyst / FA with green check or gray dash
- Receipts: show 2 quote blocks (each <= 20 words)
- Footer: Position size guidance

If social_trading_signal is missing, show a fallback card:
"Social signal unavailable, showing best-ranked candidates instead."

3) Buckets section
Render 5 collapsible groups (or simple headers) with compact cards:
- Equities: Large Caps
- Equities: Mid Caps
- Equities: Small + Micro
- Crypto
- Commodities

Each item card should show:
- Symbol
- Rating + Confidence
- One-line reason
- Badges: social_velocity_label, score (optional), classification
- Mini confirmations row (TA/Vol/Cat/FA as icons)

Do NOT render any “Excluded” section even if the backend accidentally sends it in analysis text.
Only use structured lists for the UI.

C) Keep chat bubble clean
Chat bubble text should remain short like:
"Trending Now updated. See panel."

The detailed content must live in the panel UI, not the chat bubble.

D) Defensive parsing
If structured is missing or malformed:
- show analysis text as a plain fallback inside the panel (not the bubble)
- show a small warning badge: "Limited structured data"

E) No other changes
Do not modify askAgent payload.
Do not modify daily_briefing renderer.
Only add the cross_asset_trending panel renderer + small helper components.

After changes:
- run locally
- click Trending Now
- confirm the panel shows the hero card + grouped buckets
- publish frontend only if code changed
