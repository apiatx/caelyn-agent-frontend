## CRITICAL: X Sentiment section not rendering — verify the renderer exists

The backend is being fixed to ensure X sentiment data reaches Claude. But the frontend may also be missing the renderer.

### Step 1: Find where crypto response sections are rendered

Search for where the crypto scan response is displayed — look for references to "Hot Categories", "Top Momentum Picks", "Futures & Perps", "Squeeze Candidates" etc. These are the existing rendered sections.

### Step 2: Verify x_sentiment renderer exists

In that same component/file, search for "x_sentiment" or "X Sentiment" or "social_movers" or "Grok". If NO renderer exists for x_sentiment, ADD ONE.

The x_sentiment data in the response JSON looks like:
```json
{
    "x_sentiment": {
        "btc_sentiment": {"overall": "bullish", "score": 0.6, "key_narrative": "..."},
        "market_mood": "risk-on",
        "trending_tickers": [
            {"ticker": "OM", "social_velocity": "exploding", "sentiment": "bullish", "why_trending": "...", "catalyst": "..."}
        ],
        "top_social_movers": [...],  // Alternative field name
        "narrative_heat": [{"narrative": "Gaming", "buzz_level": "hot", "direction": "bullish", "top_tokens": ["AXS", "GALA"]}],
        "contrarian_signals": ["..."],
        "summary": "..."
    }
}
```

NOTE: The trending tickers might be under `trending_tickers` OR `top_social_movers` — check both.

### Step 3: Place the section ABOVE Top Momentum Picks

The render order should be:
1. Market Overview
2. BTC / ETH cards
3. Hot Categories
4. Futures & Perps (squeeze candidates, crowded longs, divergences, top perps table)
5. **𝕏 Sentiment — Powered by Grok** ← HERE
6. Top Momentum Picks
7. Upcoming Catalysts

### Step 4: Render these sub-sections:

**Section header**: `𝕏 Sentiment — Powered by Grok` with market_mood badge (green pill for risk-on, red for risk-off, gray for mixed)

**BTC Sentiment card** (always first):
- Background: same as BTC card at top
- Show: `BTC  [BULLISH badge]  Score: 0.6`
- Below: `key_narrative` text
- Read from: `x_sentiment.btc_sentiment.overall` (or `.sentiment`), `.score`, `.key_narrative`

**Top Social Movers** (card list):
[SYMBOL]    [velocity badge]    [sentiment badge]
[why_trending text]
Catalyst: [catalyst text]
- Read from: `x_sentiment.trending_tickers` OR `x_sentiment.top_social_movers`
- Velocity badges: "exploding" = red bg, "surging" = orange, "rising" = yellow, "steady" = gray
- Sentiment badges: "bullish" = green, "bearish" = red, "mixed"/"neutral" = gray
- Show up to 8 items

**Narrative Heat** (horizontal cards like Hot Categories):
[Narrative Name]
[buzz_level badge]  [direction]
Top: SYM1, SYM2, SYM3
- Read from: `x_sentiment.narrative_heat`
- hot = red/orange accent, warm = yellow, cold = blue

**Contrarian Signals** (if present):
⚠️ [signal text]
- Yellow border callout box
- Only show if array has items

**Summary** paragraph at bottom of section.

### Step 5: Remove "Funding" from Top Momentum Picks

In the momentum picks card renderer, remove the "Funding:" data field line. It's redundant with the Funding Divergences section above it. The thesis text already mentions funding when relevant.

### Graceful fallback
If `x_sentiment` is null/undefined/empty, don't show the section header or any cards. Check:
```javascript
const xData = response.x_sentiment;
const hasSocial = xData && (
    (xData.trending_tickers?.length > 0) || 
    (xData.top_social_movers?.length > 0) ||
    xData.summary
);
if (!hasSocial) return null;
```

### Testing
1. Click "Crypto" → X Sentiment section appears between Perps and Momentum Picks
2. BTC sentiment card shows with colored badge
3. Social movers show with velocity badges
4. Narrative heat cards display
5. If Grok data unavailable, section doesn't render (no empty section)
6. Momentum picks don't show "Funding:" line anymore
7. All other sections still work
