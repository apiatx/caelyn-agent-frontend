            {l:'🔥 Best Trades', p:'Show me the best trade SETUPS right now — I want stocks with multiple technical indicators aligning: MACD crossovers, RSI in the 50-65 sweet spot, price above rising 20 and 50 SMAs, volume 2x+ average CONFIRMING the move. Stage 2 breakouts only. Show me the quant score, every TA indicator, social sentiment, and a trade plan with entry/stop/target for each. I want setups, not stocks that already pumped.'},
            {l:'💎 Best Investments', p:'Show me the best investment opportunities — stocks with ACCELERATING revenue growth (QoQ and YoY), expanding EBITDA margins, low P/S relative to growth rate, insider buying, and analyst upgrades. Run the SQGLP framework on each. I want to see the fundamental numbers: revenue growth rate, margin trajectory, valuation multiples, earnings beat streak. Show me stocks where fundamentals are improving AND the chart confirms with a Stage 2 trend.'},
            {l:'📈 Improving Fundamentals', p:'Scan the market for stocks with the most rapidly improving financial metrics. I want to see: revenue acceleration (growth rate increasing quarter over quarter), EBITDA margin expansion, companies turning profitable for the first time, raised guidance, consecutive earnings beats, and improving free cash flow.

Tell me: is it risk-on or risk-off right now? Which sectors should I favor? What is the liquidity environment? What economic data releases are coming this week that could move markets? Should I be increasing or decreasing leverage based on current conditions?'},
            {l:'💥 Short Squeeze', p:'Scan for short squeeze setups. I need: short interest >15% of float, days to cover >3, rising borrow cost, volume surging above average, price moving UP (shorts getting squeezed, not shorts winning), positive social sentiment acceleration, and ideally a bullish catalyst. Show me short float %, days to cover, volume ratio, social buzz level, and a trade plan for each. Filter out anything with declining price — I want squeezes that are STARTING, not over.'},

For each show me: exact volume ratio (e.g. 4.2x average), whether price is UP or DOWN on the volume (accumulation vs distribution), what is likely causing the spike (news, earnings, insider activity?), and the technical setup. High volume + price up = institutional buying signal. High volume + price down = distribution warning.'},
            {l:'📅 Earnings Watch', p:'Show me the most important upcoming earnings in the next 7 days, ranked by volatility potential.

Show me the math: worst case floor price, base case target, best case target, and the probability-weighted expected return.'},
