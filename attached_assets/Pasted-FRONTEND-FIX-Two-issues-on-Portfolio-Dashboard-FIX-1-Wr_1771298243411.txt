FRONTEND FIX: Two issues on Portfolio Dashboard

=== FIX 1: Wrong TradingView chart symbols ===

The TradingView symbol mapping for crypto and commodities needs corrections. Some symbols like BINANCE:HYPEUSDT and TVC:COPPER don't exist on TradingView. 

Update the CRYPTO_TV_SYMBOLS mapping. Not all crypto are on Binance. Use this updated mapping:

HYPE → "BYBIT:HYPEUSDT" (Hyperliquid is on Bybit, not Binance)
TAO → "BYBIT:TAOUSDT"
WIF → "BYBIT:WIFUSDT"
TIA → "BYBIT:TIAUSDT"
SEI → "BYBIT:SEIUSDT"

All other major crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, XRP, etc.) stay as BINANCE:{ticker}USDT — those are fine.

For the fallback when a ticker isn't in the map, try multiple exchanges:
Instead of defaulting to just BINANCE:{ticker}USDT, use this fallback logic:
1. Check the explicit map first
2. If not in map, default to "CRYPTO:{ticker}USD" — this is TradingView's aggregate crypto symbol format that works for most coins

Update the COMMODITY_TV_SYMBOLS mapping — some are wrong:

COPPER → "COMEX:HG1!" (not TVC:COPPER)
SILVER → "TVC:SILVER" (this one already works, keep it)
GOLD → "TVC:GOLD" (keep)
OIL → "TVC:USOIL" (keep)
CRUDE → "TVC:USOIL" (keep)
NATGAS → "NYMEX:NG1!" (more reliable than TVC:NATURALGAS)
PLATINUM → "NYMEX:PL1!"
PALLADIUM → "NYMEX:PA1!"
WHEAT → "CBOT:ZW1!"
CORN → "CBOT:ZC1!"

=== FIX 2: Crypto and commodity prices not displaying ===

The Price, Daily P&L, Total P&L, and Weight% columns show dashes for HYPE, SILVER, COPPER, and possibly other crypto/commodities. This means either:

A) The frontend is not reading the price data from the quotes API response for these tickers, OR
B) The quotes API is not returning price data for them

Debug step: After fetching from /api/portfolio/quotes, add a console.log of the full response. Check if HYPE, SILVER, COPPER have price data in the response. 

If prices ARE in the response but not displaying: The frontend is probably matching quotes to holdings by ticker but the case or format doesn't match. Make sure the matching is case-insensitive.

If prices are NOT in the response: The backend fix hasn't been applied yet or isn't working. Check the backend Replit logs for print statements like "[PORTFOLIO] CoinGecko: HYPE = $XX" or "[PORTFOLIO] Commodity: SILVER = $XX". If these logs don't appear, the backend routing by asset_type isn't working.

Add a console.log right after the quotes fetch:
console.log("Quotes response:", JSON.stringify(quotesData));

This will tell us exactly where the data breaks.
