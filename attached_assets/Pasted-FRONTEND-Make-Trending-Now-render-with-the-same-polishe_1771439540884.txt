FRONTEND: Make Trending Now render with the same polished UI quality as Daily Briefing, without changing backend response quality.

Goal:
Trending Now currently displays as plain analyst text (analysis string). Daily Briefing is pretty because we render a structured panel. Implement the same approach for Trending Now.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change payload contract.
- Do NOT change backend prompts or scoring.
- Do NOT reintroduce JSON.stringify into chat bubble.
- Keep storing full parsed response in panel.data.parsed for debugging.
- Only change the renderer: how we display the existing response.

Steps:

1) Identify the display_type for Trending Now
- In the response envelope, look at:
  data.structured.display_type OR data.type OR data.structured.type (whichever you use)
- Confirm what value is coming back when clicking Trending Now.
  Likely: "cross_asset_trending" or similar.

2) Build a dedicated renderer for Trending Now
Create a component like:
  CrossAssetTrendingPanel.tsx
(or add it into the existing panel switch)

It should render sections with clean styling (use the Daily Briefing UI patterns):
- Section header row with an icon + title + small subtitle
- Card containers for each group
- Badges for regime, rating, velocity
- Confidence as a pill or right-aligned badge (0-100)

3) Render from structured fields first
Use:
  const s = panel.data.parsed?.structured ?? panel.data.structured ?? null

We want:
- Macro block:
  - Macro Regime (regime + confidence)
  - Key numbers (Fear & Greed, VIX)
  - Optional summary paragraph
- Asset class outlook block:
  - Equities, Crypto, Commodities with short 1-liners
- Lists:
  - Equities: Large Caps, Mid Caps, Small/Micro
  - Crypto
  - Commodities

Each asset row/card should show:
- Ticker (bold)
- Tag like [TRADE IDEA] or [WATCHLIST] as a badge
- Rating badge (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Sell)
- Confidence score badge (0-100)
- Optional: market cap, change, velocity
- 2 to 4 bullets max:
  - reason/thesis
  - catalyst
  - confirmations (TA/VOL/CAT/FA) as small chips
  - risk line in muted text
- Position tier shown as small text at bottom right

4) If structured data is missing fields, do graceful fallback
If s is null or missing the arrays:
- Show analysis text as a fallback (same behavior as today)
- BUT do not show "Response received. See panel data for details."
Always show something.

5) Update the panel router
Where you route based on display_type, add:
- case "cross_asset_trending": render <CrossAssetTrendingPanel ... />

6) Keep chat bubble clean
Chat bubble should show a short title only, like:
"Trending Now"
and not the entire analysis block.

7) Testing
- Click Daily Briefing: unchanged.
- Click Trending Now: should render in sections/cards, with confidence next to each ticker.
- Confirm no JSON dumps.
- Confirm the panel renders even when some fields are missing (analysis fallback).

Deliverable:
- Commit the new panel component
- Confirm display_type mapping used
- Provide a screenshot-style description of the new layout
