## Remove Index/Indices from Portfolio Dashboard completely

### Changes needed:

#### 1. Remove "Index" from the Add Holding type dropdown
Find the asset type dropdown in the Add Holding form. Remove the "Index" option. The dropdown should only have:
- Stock
- ETF
- Crypto
- Commodity

#### 2. Remove "Indices" from the Asset Allocation chart
Find the Asset Allocation donut chart component. Remove the "Indices" category from the chart categories. Only these categories should exist:
- Stocks (green)
- ETFs (blue)
- Crypto (amber)
- Commodities (red)

If any existing holdings have type "Index" or "index", reclassify them as "ETF" for display purposes in the chart.

#### 3. Handle any existing index holdings gracefully
If a user already has holdings with type "Index" saved in their portfolio data:
- Display them as normal rows in the table (don't hide or delete them)
- Treat them as "ETF" for the Asset Allocation chart
- Show a small note or toast suggesting the user delete the index holding and re-add as the ETF equivalent

#### 4. Revert any index-specific TradingView chart logic
If any index-specific TradingView symbol mappings were added to the portfolio chart component (VIX → VIXY, SPX → SPY, etc.), remove them. The portfolio page should only handle:
- Stocks: use raw ticker (e.g., NVDA)
- ETFs: use raw ticker (e.g., SPY, QQQ)
- Crypto: use BINANCE:{ticker}USDT mapping
- Commodities: use raw ticker (e.g., GLD, SLV, USO)

No index-specific chart handling needed since we're removing index support.

#### 5. Do NOT touch anything outside the Portfolio Dashboard page
- Do NOT change the main chat/agent page
- Do NOT change the ticker strip at the top of the site
- Do NOT change the macro dashboard
- Do NOT change how Daily Briefing, Trending Now, or Best Trades reference indices
- These all use separate backend endpoints that correctly handle VIX, SPX, DJI as indices

### Testing
1. Add Holding dropdown shows only: Stock, ETF, Crypto, Commodity — no Index option
2. Asset Allocation chart shows only: Stocks, ETFs, Crypto, Commodities categories
3. If VIX/SPX holdings exist from before, they still appear in the table (user can delete them manually)
4. All stock, ETF, crypto, commodity holdings display correctly with prices, P&L, charts
5. Main agent page (Daily Briefing, Trending Now, Best Trades) is completely unaffected
