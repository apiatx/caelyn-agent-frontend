You are modifying the frontend only.

Do NOT modify:

Backend endpoints

Data providers

Model logic

Claude prompts

OpenAI classifier logic

Your job:

REMOVE all orchestration logic, intent profiles, module configs, scoring logic from the frontend.

Ensure each preset button sends ONLY an intent key.

Each button click should send a payload like:

{
  "query": "",
  "preset_intent": "intent_key_here"
}


If user types in the input box and clicks Analyze:

{
  "query": "user typed message",
  "preset_intent": null
}


DO NOT construct prompt templates in frontend.

DO NOT build keyword-based strings.

DO NOT append system instructions.

DO NOT modify user query text.

Frontend is a transport layer only.

Ensure no token-splitting or comma-joining logic exists.

Ensure chat history stores:

query

preset_intent

response

timestamp

When loading previous chat, re-send conversation context exactly as stored.

Do NOT reintroduce orchestration logic into frontend.

Frontend must remain a clean UI transport layer.
