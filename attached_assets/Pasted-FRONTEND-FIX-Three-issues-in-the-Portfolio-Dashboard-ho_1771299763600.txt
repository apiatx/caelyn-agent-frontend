FRONTEND FIX: Three issues in the Portfolio Dashboard holdings table dropdown

=== FIX 1: COPPER TradingView chart symbol wrong ===

The COMEX:HG1! symbol requires a TradingView subscription and won't render in the free widget. Change the copper mapping to use the free CFD symbol instead.

In the commodity TradingView symbol mapping, change:
COPPER → "TVC:COPPER" 

Wait — that was the original and it didn't work either. The correct free symbol for copper on TradingView is:
COPPER → "PEPPERSTONE:COPPER"

If that doesn't work, try: "OANDA:XCUUSD"

The issue is that futures symbols (COMEX:HG1!) require a paid TradingView data subscription. CFD symbols from brokers like Pepperstone or Oanda are free. Silver works because TVC:SILVER is a free CFD-based symbol.

Update the commodity mapping to use free symbols:
COPPER → "PEPPERSTONE:COPPER" (or fallback "OANDA:XCUUSD")
NATGAS → "PEPPERSTONE:NATGAS" (or fallback "TVC:NATURALGAS") 
PLATINUM → "TVC:PLATINUM"
PALLADIUM → "TVC:PALLADIUM"
WHEAT → "PEPPERSTONE:WHEAT"
CORN → "PEPPERSTONE:CORN"

Keep SILVER → "TVC:SILVER" and GOLD → "TVC:GOLD" and OIL → "TVC:USOIL" since those already work.

=== FIX 2: Remove the "000" text and fix data fields in dropdown ===

When a holding row is expanded, there is a "000" showing below the chart. This is a rendering bug — probably a placeholder or malformed data field. Remove it entirely.

=== FIX 3: Show correct data fields per asset type in the dropdown ===

Below the TradingView chart in each expanded row, show data cards/badges with relevant info from the quotes response. The fields shown should vary by asset type:

For STOCKS:
- Market Cap (from quotes response "market_cap" field, format as $X.XB or $X.XM)
- Volume (from quotes response "volume" field, format as X.XM or X.XK)
- Sector (from quotes response "sector" field)
- Price Change (from quotes response "change_pct" field, format as +X.XX% in green or -X.XX% in red)

For CRYPTO:
- Market Cap (from quotes response "market_cap" field)
- Volume (from quotes response "volume" field)
- Sector (show "Crypto")
- Price Change (from quotes response "change_pct" field)

For COMMODITIES:
- Volume (from quotes response "volume" field)
- Sector (show "Commodities")
- Price Change (from quotes response "change_pct" field)

For ETFs:
- Volume (from quotes response "volume" field)
- Sector (from quotes response "sector" field or "ETFs")
- Price Change (from quotes response "change_pct" field)

For INDICES:
- Price Change (from quotes response "change_pct" field)

Use the holding's asset_type to determine which fields to show. Style them as small cards/badges in a horizontal row below the chart, matching the current dark theme. If a field's value is null or undefined, don't show that card at all — don't show "000" or empty values.

The current layout already shows these cards (Volume, Sector, Industry are visible in the screenshots). Just:
1. Remove the "000" text
2. Replace "Industry" with "Price Change" 
3. Add "Market Cap" for stocks and crypto
4. Conditionally show/hide fields based on asset_type as described above
