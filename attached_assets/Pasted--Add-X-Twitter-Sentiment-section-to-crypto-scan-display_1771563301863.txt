## Add: X/Twitter Sentiment section to crypto scan display + fix OI display

### 1. Fix OI column in Top Perps by Volume table
The OI column currently shows "-" for all coins. The backend now sends `open_interest_usd` in each item of the perps_top_volume array. Update the table rendering to display it:
```javascript
// Format OI value
const oi = item.open_interest_usd;
const oiDisplay = oi ? formatLargeNumber(oi) : '—';
```

Make sure the table has 5 rows (not 4) and the OI column displays properly.

### 2. Add "X Sentiment — Powered by Grok" section
The backend response now includes an `x_sentiment` object. Render this as a new section AFTER the "Futures & Perps" section and BEFORE "Top Momentum Picks".

#### Section Header:
𝕏 Sentiment — Powered by Grok

#### BTC Sentiment Card (always show first):
BTC Sentiment: [BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL]    Score: [X.X]
[key_narrative text]
- Green background tint if bullish, red if bearish, gray if neutral
- Data: `x_sentiment.btc_sentiment`

#### Market Mood Badge:
Show as a colored pill next to the header:
- "risk-on" → green pill
- "risk-off" → red pill
- "euphoric" → bright green pill
- "fearful" → bright red pill
- "mixed" → gray pill

Data: `x_sentiment.market_mood`

#### Top Social Movers (cards, similar to momentum picks):
For each item in `x_sentiment.top_social_movers` (or `x_sentiment.trending_tickers`):
[SYMBOL]                    [social_velocity badge]   [sentiment badge]
[why_trending text]
Catalyst: [catalyst text]

- social_velocity badges: "exploding" = bright red/orange pulsing, "surging" = orange, "rising" = yellow, "steady" = gray
- sentiment badges: "bullish" = green, "bearish" = red, "mixed" = gray
- Show up to 8 tokens

#### Narrative Heat (horizontal card row, similar to Hot Categories):
[Narrative Name]
[buzz_level]  [direction]
Top tokens: SYM1, SYM2
- Hot = red/orange accent, Warm = yellow accent, Cold = blue accent
- Data: `x_sentiment.narrative_heat`

#### Contrarian Signals (if present):
Show as a small callout box with ⚠️ icon:
⚠️ Contrarian Signal: [signal text]
- Yellow/amber accent border
- Only show if array has items

#### Summary:
Show `x_sentiment.summary` as a paragraph below the cards, similar to how the market overview text appears at the top of the crypto response.

### Graceful fallback
If `x_sentiment` is null/empty/undefined, don't show the section at all. Don't show empty headers.

### Testing
1. Click "Crypto" → X Sentiment section appears with BTC sentiment, social movers, narrative heat
2. Top Perps table shows 5 rows with OI values (not "-")
3. Social velocity badges render correctly
4. If X data is unavailable, section simply doesn't appear
5. All existing sections still render correctly
