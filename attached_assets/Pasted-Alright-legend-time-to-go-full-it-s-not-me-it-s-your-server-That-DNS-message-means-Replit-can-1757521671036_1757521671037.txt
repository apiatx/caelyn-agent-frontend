Alright, legend — time to go full “it’s not me, it’s your server.” That DNS message means Replit can’t find a live web service behind that URL. Let’s force this thing green with a quick, surgical debug that works no matter your stack.

Step 1: Prove the port works with a known-good server

In the Replit Shell, run ONE of these. If you don’t know your stack, just do Node or Python.

Node sanity server

printf '%s\n' "import http from 'http';
const port = Number(process.env.PORT || 3000);
const host = '0.0.0.0';
http.createServer((_, res)=>{res.end('ok')}).listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log('listening on', host, port);
});" > sanity.mjs
node sanity.mjs


Python sanity server

python - <<'PY'
import os, http.server, socketserver
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", "8000"))
host = "0.0.0.0"
class H(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200); self.end_headers(); self.wfile.write(b"ok")
with socketserver.TCPServer((host, port), H) as httpd:
    print("listening on", host, port); httpd.serve_forever()
PY


Wait for “listening on 0.0.0.0 <port>”.

Click Open in new tab on the preview. You should see ok.

If you still get “server IP address could not be found”

This means the URL you’re opening is stale or the repl isn’t exposing the service to Replit’s router.

Do this:

Click Stop, then Run again.

Use the exact URL that appears in the Webview after it starts. If you renamed or forked the repl, the old kirk.replit.dev subdomain is dead.

Try the little globe icon or “Open in Browser” to force the new URL.

If the sanity server shows ok in browser, your networking is fine and the issue is with your app’s start command or host/port binding. Keep going.

Step 2: Fix your real app’s start command

Open your .replit and make sure run actually launches a server that binds to 0.0.0.0 on $PORT.

Examples

Express

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log('up on', port));


.replit

run = "node index.js"


Flask

app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)))


.replit

run = "python main.py"


FastAPI/Uvicorn

run = "uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"


Vite
In vite.config.js:

export default {
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: process.env.PORT && Number(process.env.PORT)
  }
}


.replit

run = "vite"


Next.js (production)

run = "PORT=$PORT HOST=0.0.0.0 next start"


Build first: next build.

Static site

run = "python -m http.server $PORT --bind 0.0.0.0"


Do not bind to localhost or 127.0.0.1. Do not hardcode 3000 or 8000 without using $PORT.

Step 3: Verify from inside the repl

In the Shell, while your app is “Up”:

echo "PORT is $PORT"
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/ | head


If curl returns HTML or text, your app is running. If the browser still fails, you’re on the wrong URL.

Step 4: Common gotchas that keep biting people

Wrong URL: Use the current Webview URL after Run, not an old saved tab.

Run task exits: Your run script starts tests or a build and quits. It must keep a server process alive.

Crashes on boot: Check the Console for stack traces or missing env vars.

Dev servers ignoring PORT: Some CLIs need explicit env. Set PORT=$PORT and HOST=0.0.0.0 in the run line.

Nix deps missing: If uvicorn, node, etc. not found, add to replit.nix and click Rebuild.

Ad blocker/VPN: Yes, annoyingly, these can eat previews. Try a normal browser window.
