You previously added orchestration logic and canonical intent definitions to the frontend. That is incorrect architecture.

We are reverting the frontend to a lightweight command layer.

Do the following:

Remove all orchestration logic, scoring logic, and intent profile definitions from the frontend.

Remove any large preset prompt text blobs from button handlers.

Remove any business logic related to:

module activation

asset filtering

fundamental/technical weighting

sentiment rules

Frontend must NOT define intelligence.

Replace All Preset Buttons With Intent Keys Only

Each button should send a minimal payload:

await fetch("/analyze", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: userInput || "",
    preset_intent: "daily_briefing"
  })
})


Each button only sends:

preset_intent: "<intent_key>"


No prompt strings.
No keyword arrays.
No text concatenation.
No template text.
