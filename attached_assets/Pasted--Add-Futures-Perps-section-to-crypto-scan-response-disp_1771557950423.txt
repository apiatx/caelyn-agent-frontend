## Add: Futures/Perps section to crypto scan response display

### What's changing
The backend crypto response now includes HyperLiquid perpetual futures data. A new section needs to be rendered in the crypto scan panel.

### New sections to render (after Hot Categories, before or after Top Momentum Picks):

#### 1. "Futures & Perps — Hyperliquid" section header

#### 2. Market Summary bar (horizontal stats bar, similar to how BTC/ETH cards are laid out):
Total OI: $X.XB  |  24h Volume: $X.XB  |  Avg Funding: X.XXX%  |  Bias: [market_bias text]
Data source: `perps_overview.market_summary`

Style this as a single card with stats spread horizontally. Use ice-blue for the numbers.

#### 3. Squeeze Candidates (HIGH PRIORITY — these are the best trade signals)
Render as cards similar to Top Momentum Picks. Each card shows:
[COIN]    Funding: -X.XX%    OI: $X.XM    24h: +X.X%
Signal: [signal text]
- Use a RED/ORANGE accent border for these cards (high-signal trades)
- "SQUEEZE" badge in orange/red
- Data source: `perps_squeezes` array

#### 4. Crowded Longs (liquidation risk warnings)
Render as smaller cards or a compact list:
[COIN]    Funding: +X.XX%    OI: $X.XM    ⚠️ [signal]
- Use YELLOW accent for warning
- Data source: `perps_crowded_longs` array

#### 5. Funding Divergences (if present)
[COIN]   Type: BULLISH_DIVERGENCE   Funding: -X.XX%   Price: +X.X%
[signal text]
- BULLISH_DIVERGENCE → green accent
- BEARISH_DIVERGENCE → red accent
- Data source: `perps_divergences` array

#### 6. Top Perps by Volume (compact list/table)
Show as a small table or horizontal scroll of the most active futures:
Coin    Volume 24h    Funding    24h Change
BTC     $XX.XB       +0.001%    +0.5%
ETH     $XX.XB       +0.002%    -0.8%
...
- Data source: `perps_top_volume` array

### Styling
Match the existing crypto scan card styling (dark backgrounds, monospace for numbers, colored percentages). The perps section should feel like a natural extension of the existing crypto scan output.

### Graceful fallback
If `perps_overview` or any perps field is missing/null, don't show that section. Don't show empty sections.

### Testing
1. Click "Crypto" → should see a "Futures & Perps" section below Hot Categories
2. Squeeze candidates should display with funding rates
3. Crowded longs should display with warning signals
4. Market summary bar should show total OI and volume
5. If HyperLiquid data is unavailable, section simply doesn't appear
6. All existing crypto sections (BTC/ETH, Hot Categories, Top Momentum) still render correctly
