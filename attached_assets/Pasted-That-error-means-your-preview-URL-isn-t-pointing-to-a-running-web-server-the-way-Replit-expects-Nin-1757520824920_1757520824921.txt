That error means your preview URL isn’t pointing to a running web server the way Replit expects. Nine times out of ten it’s one of these:

Quick checklist

Your app isn’t listening on the right host/port

Replit assigns a port. You must use it, and bind to 0.0.0.0.

Node/Express:

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log('up on', port));


Flask:

import os
port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080))
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port)


FastAPI/Uvicorn:

uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT


Vite dev server:

vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT


or in vite.config.js:

export default { server: { host: true, port: process.env.PORT && Number(process.env.PORT) } }


Your run command doesn’t start a server

Open .replit and make sure run = "<your start command>" actually launches the server, not tests or a script that exits.

Example:

run = "node index.js"


or

run = "python main.py"


You started on a fixed port like 3000 and it’s blocked

Don’t hardcode 3000/8000 only. Use process.env.PORT or os.environ["PORT"] as above.

Process crashes on boot

Open the Console tab and run it. Look for stack traces, missing env vars, or import errors. Fix those first.

Wrong framework command

Next.js often needs next start for a built server, not next dev, and still must bind host/port:

PORT=$PORT HOST=0.0.0.0 next start


Port not exposed

Some setups need to tell Replit which port to open. In .replit you can add:

[env]
PORT=8000

[nix]
# leave as generated by Replit

[interpreter]
# leave as generated

[debug]
run = "uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"


Then ensure your code uses that same PORT.

Stale DNS / sleeping repl

Click Stop, then Run again to wake it.

Open the “Webview” again or click “Open in new tab.”

If you changed the repl name or forked it, the old kirk.replit.dev subdomain may be dead. Use the new URL shown in the Webview.

Ad blocker or VPN eating the preview

Temporarily disable ad blockers or VPN and retry.

Static site but no server

Serve it. Easiest:

python -m http.server $PORT --bind 0.0.0.0


or install serve for React builds:

npx serve -s build -l $PORT --listen 0.0.0.0


Project is Nix but missing dependencies

If your server command isn’t found, add packages to replit.nix and click “Rebuild.”

Fastest path to green

Open .replit and ensure run starts your server.

Update your app to use PORT and 0.0.0.0 exactly.

Hit Stop, then Run.

Use the preview link shown after it boots. If it still shows that specific long subdomain, you’re likely pointing at an old repl URL.
