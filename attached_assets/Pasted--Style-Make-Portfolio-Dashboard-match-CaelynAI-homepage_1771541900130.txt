## Style: Make Portfolio Dashboard match CaelynAI homepage branding

### Context
The CaelynAI homepage has a polished dark theme with specific styling (deep navy/dark blue backgrounds, subtle gradient accents, the CaelynAI logo/mascot, consistent color palette). The Portfolio Dashboard page works perfectly but uses a more generic dark theme that doesn't match. I want visual consistency across both pages WITHOUT changing any functionality or layout.

### What to match from the CaelynAI homepage:
- Background: Deep dark navy/charcoal (not pure black) — match the exact background color from the homepage
- Card backgrounds: Slightly lighter than the page background with subtle borders — match the homepage card style
- Accent colors: The homepage uses a blue/cyan/teal accent theme (visible in the sidebar active state, buttons, links)
- Font styling: Match the homepage typography (font family, heading weights, text colors)
- The CaelynAI branding at the top of the sidebar should be consistent across both pages (same logo, same styling)
- Button style: The "AI Portfolio Review" button and "+ Add" button should use the same button styling as the homepage (gradient or accent-colored buttons)
- Table styling: The holdings table should feel like it belongs on the same site as the homepage — matching row hover states, border colors, text colors
- Green/red for positive/negative P&L should stay as-is (this is universal trading convention)

### Specific changes needed:

#### 1. Page background
Match the homepage background color exactly. Check what CSS the homepage uses for its main background and apply the same to the Portfolio Dashboard page.

#### 2. Card/panel backgrounds
The Asset Allocation chart, Daily P&L chart, and the holdings table container should use the same card background and border style as the homepage panels.

#### 3. Header area
The "Portfolio Dashboard" header with total/day/total P&L should match the styling of headers on the homepage. Use the same font weights and colors.

#### 4. Buttons
- "AI Portfolio Review" button: Use the same gradient/accent style as primary buttons on the homepage
- "Refresh" button: Use the same secondary button style as the homepage
- "+ Add" button: Match the primary button style
- Dropdown: Match the select/dropdown styling from the homepage

#### 5. Table
- Row backgrounds, hover states, borders should match the homepage aesthetic
- Ticker names should be bold/white matching how tickers appear on the homepage
- The company name subtitle should be the same muted gray as the homepage uses

#### 6. Charts
- The donut chart and bar chart backgrounds should match card styling
- Chart colors (green for stocks, blue for ETFs, amber for crypto, red for commodities) can stay as they are — these are good
- Chart label text colors should match the homepage text colors

#### 7. Sidebar
Make sure the sidebar on the Portfolio Dashboard page matches exactly the sidebar on the homepage — same logo, same menu items, same active state styling, same colors. If there are any differences, make them identical.

### CRITICAL: Do NOT change:
- Any functionality (data fetching, calculations, P&L logic, chart data)
- The layout/structure of the page (keep the same arrangement of elements)
- The holdings table columns or data
- The Add Holding form fields
- The AI Portfolio Review button behavior
- Chart types or data sources
- Any backend API calls

This is purely a CSS/styling pass to make the Portfolio Dashboard visually consistent with the CaelynAI homepage.

### Testing
1. Open CaelynAI homepage and Portfolio Dashboard side by side — they should feel like the same app
2. All data still displays correctly (prices, P&L, percentages, charts)
3. All buttons still work (AI Portfolio Review, Refresh, Add, Delete)
4. Charts still render with correct data
5. Sidebar navigation works identically on both pages
6. Mobile responsiveness is not broken
