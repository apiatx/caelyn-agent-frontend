FRONTEND Replit Agent:
Please rebuild the Portfolio + Other page from a boring link page into a full portfolio tracking dashboard. Remove the existing link cards (Yahoo Finance, Snowball, Simply Wall St, Schwab, Robinhood, Empower). Replace with:
Section 1: Portfolio Input (top of page)
A clean form where the user can add holdings:
[Ticker Input] [Shares Input] [Avg Cost Input] [Add +]
Below the input, show the current portfolio as an editable table:
Ticker | Shares | Avg Cost | Current Price | Daily P&L | Total P&L | Weight% | [Delete]
NVDA   | 50     | $120.00  | $138.50       | +$2.30    | +$925.00  | 22.4%   | 🗑️
AMD    | 100    | $155.00  | $162.30       | -$1.20    | +$730.00  | 18.1%   | 🗑️
...
                             TOTAL VALUE: $30,850    Daily: +$145   Total: +$4,230

Store holdings in the backend using a new /api/portfolio/holdings endpoint (same JSON file approach as chat history — zero cost)
Current prices fetched from the backend via FMP quotes
Auto-refresh prices every 60 seconds during market hours
Sortable columns (click to sort by P&L, weight, etc.)

Section 2: Portfolio Visualization
Two charts side by side:

Allocation Pie Chart — Sector breakdown of your portfolio (use Recharts pie chart). Each slice shows sector name + percentage. Color-coded.
Daily P&L Bar Chart — Today's gain/loss per position as horizontal bars. Green for up, red for down. Biggest movers at top.

Section 3: Position Health Cards
For each holding, show an expandable card with:

Mini TradingView chart (use TradingView lightweight widget iframe):

html  <iframe src="https://s.tradingview.com/widgetembed/?symbol=TICKER&interval=D&theme=dark&style=1&timezone=America/New_York&width=100%&height=200" width="100%" height="200" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
```
- Analyst consensus (from FMP or StockAnalysis): Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Sell
- Average price target vs current price
- Upcoming earnings date
- Upcoming ex-dividend date
- Social sentiment badge (StockTwits bullish/bearish %)

Cards are collapsed by default showing just ticker, price, P&L. Click to expand for full detail.

### Section 4: AI Portfolio Review Button

**A prominent button at the top: "🤖 AI Portfolio Review"**

When clicked, it takes all the user's holdings and sends them to the existing `/api/watchlist` endpoint (same one the chat uses). The agent then returns a full portfolio analysis. Display the response in-page using the same renderer as the chat interface.

### Section 5: Upcoming Events for My Holdings

**A timeline/calendar view showing:**
- Earnings dates for holdings (from FMP earnings calendar endpoint)
- Ex-dividend dates (from FMP dividend calendar endpoint)
- Sorted chronologically, next event first
- Color-coded: orange for earnings within 7 days, blue for dividends

### Section 6: Quick Links (keep a small version)

**Keep the broker links but make them a small row of icon buttons at the very bottom of the page, not the main content:**
```
[Schwab] [Chase] [Robinhood] [Yahoo Finance] [Empower]
Small icon-only buttons that open in new tabs. These are utilities, not the main feature.
Styling

Match the existing dark theme of the site
Use the same purple accent color for highlights
Cards should have the same dark glass-morphism style as the rest of the site
Responsive — portfolio table becomes scrollable cards on mobile
