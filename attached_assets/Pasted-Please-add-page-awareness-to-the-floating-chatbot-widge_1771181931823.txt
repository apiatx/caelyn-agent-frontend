Please add page-awareness to the floating chatbot widget. This should NOT change any existing chatbot functionality — it's purely additive. The chatbot should still be able to answer all the same queries it already can.
What to add:
1. Add a pageContext state to the ChatbotContext:
tsxconst [pageContext, setPageContext] = useState<{ pageName: string; data: any } | null>(null);
Expose both pageContext and setPageContext in the context provider.
2. Create a simple hook usePageContext:
tsxexport function usePageContext(pageName: string, data: any) {
  const { setPageContext } = useChatbot();
  useEffect(() => {
    setPageContext({ pageName, data });
    return () => setPageContext(null);
  }, [pageName, JSON.stringify(data)]);
}
```

**3. On each page that displays data, call the hook with the page name and whatever data state is available.** For example on the stocks dashboard: `usePageContext("Stocks Dashboard", { topGainers, topLosers, sectors })`. Do this for every page that has market data. For static pages, don't add the hook.

**4. In the chatbot widget, add ONE button — "✨ Analyze This Page" — that only appears when `pageContext` is not null (meaning the user is on a data page).** Put it as a prominent pill button above the input field, separate from the other quick prompt chips. Style it with a subtle gradient or accent border so it stands out.

**5. When the user clicks "Analyze This Page", it sends this prompt:**
```
[PAGE CONTEXT - The user is currently viewing the "${pageContext.pageName}" page. Here is the data currently displayed on their screen:]

${JSON.stringify(compressedPageData, null, 2)}

[END PAGE CONTEXT]

Analyze the data on this page and deliver me the most actionable insights. What stands out? What's the most compelling trade or investment opportunity based on what's shown here? Flag anything unusual — volume spikes, big movers, divergences, or setups I should be paying attention to. Be specific and reference the actual data points you see.
6. IMPORTANT: This is the ONLY time page context gets sent. Normal chatbot messages (typing a question, clicking other quick prompt buttons like "Trending" or "Best Trades") should work exactly as they do now — no page context, just the normal prompt to the backend. The page context ONLY gets included when the user explicitly clicks "Analyze This Page".
7. Compress the page data before sending — if any array has more than 15 items, slice to the first 15. If the total JSON is over 6000 characters, trim arrays further to 10 items. This keeps the prompt size reasonable.
8. When on a page with no data (static pages, landing page, etc.), the "Analyze This Page" button should not appear at all.
Re-deploy after changes.
