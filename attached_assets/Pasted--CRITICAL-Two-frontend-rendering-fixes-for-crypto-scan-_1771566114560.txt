## CRITICAL: Two frontend rendering fixes for crypto scan response

The backend is returning all the data correctly but the frontend isn't rendering two things:

### Fix 1: Add X Sentiment section renderer

The crypto scan response JSON now includes an `x_sentiment` object. The frontend has NO renderer for this section — it needs to be added.

The `x_sentiment` object in the response looks like this:
```json
{
    "x_sentiment": {
        "btc_sentiment": {
            "overall": "bullish",
            "score": 0.6,
            "key_narrative": "Institutional accumulation narrative..."
        },
        "market_mood": "risk-on",
        "top_social_movers": [
            {
                "symbol": "OM",
                "social_velocity": "exploding",
                "sentiment": "bullish",
                "sentiment_score": 0.8,
                "why_trending": "Massive squeeze play gaining attention...",
                "catalyst": "Short squeeze with -849% annualized funding"
            }
        ],
        "narrative_heat": [
            {
                "narrative": "Gaming Revival",
                "buzz_level": "hot",
                "direction": "bullish",
                "top_tokens": ["AXS", "GALA", "IMX"]
            }
        ],
        "contrarian_signals": ["BTC sentiment overly bullish..."],
        "summary": "Crypto Twitter is focused on squeeze plays..."
    }
}
```

**NOTE**: The field might also be `trending_tickers` instead of `top_social_movers` — check for both:
```javascript
const socialMovers = xSentiment.top_social_movers || xSentiment.trending_tickers || [];
```

**Where to add it**: Find the crypto response renderer component. Look for where "Futures & Perps" or "Top Momentum Picks" sections are rendered. Add the X Sentiment section BETWEEN the perps section and the momentum picks section.

**Rendering structure**:
𝕏 Sentiment — Powered by Grok    [market_mood badge]
[BTC Sentiment Card]
BTC:  [overall badge]  Score: [score]
[key_narrative text]
[Top Social Movers - cards]
For each mover:
[SYMBOL]   [social_velocity badge]   [sentiment badge]
[why_trending]
Catalyst: [catalyst]
[Narrative Heat - horizontal cards like Hot Categories]
[narrative name]
[buzz_level] [direction]
Top: SYM1, SYM2, SYM3
[Contrarian Signals - if present]
⚠️ [signal text]
[Summary paragraph]

**Styling details**:

Social velocity badges:
- "exploding": background `#dc2626` (red), white text, subtle pulse animation
- "surging": background `#f97316` (orange), white text
- "rising": background `#eab308` (yellow), dark text
- "steady": background `#374151` (gray), light text

Sentiment badges (reuse existing pattern):
- "bullish": green
- "bearish": red  
- "mixed": gray
- "neutral": gray

Market mood badge (next to section header):
- "risk-on": green pill
- "risk-off": red pill
- "euphoric": bright green
- "fearful": bright red
- "mixed": gray

BTC sentiment card: Same styling as existing BTC card at top of response. Show overall sentiment as colored badge, score as number, key_narrative as text below.

Narrative heat cards: Same styling as "Hot Categories" cards (horizontal row of cards with name, percentage/level, leaders).

Contrarian signals: Small yellow-bordered callout boxes with ⚠️ icon.

**Graceful fallback**: If `x_sentiment` is null, undefined, empty object, or missing — don't render the section at all. Check:
```javascript
const xSentiment = response.x_sentiment;
const hasXSentiment = xSentiment && (
    xSentiment.summary || 
    (xSentiment.top_social_movers || xSentiment.trending_tickers || []).length > 0
);
if (!hasXSentiment) return null; // Don't render section
```

### Fix 2: Fix 7d and 30d display in Top Momentum Picks

The momentum picks cards show "7d: N/A" and "30d: —" even when the backend sends the data. The issue is likely a field name mismatch between what the backend returns and what the frontend reads.

The backend may return the 7d change as ANY of these field names:
- `change_7d`
- `price_change_7d`
- `7d_change`
- `change_7d_pct`

And the price as:
- `price`
- `current_price`
- `mark_price`

**Find the momentum picks renderer** and update the field reading to check multiple names:
```javascript
// For each momentum pick, read with fallbacks:
const price = pick.price || pick.current_price || pick.mark_price;
const change24h = pick.change_24h || pick.price_change_24h;
const change7d = pick.change_7d || pick.price_change_7d || pick["7d_change"];
const change30d = pick.change_30d || pick.price_change_30d || pick["30d_change"];
const fundingRate = pick.funding_rate || pick.fundingRate;
const openInterest = pick.open_interest || pick.openInterest || pick.open_interest_usd;
const marketCap = pick.market_cap || pick.marketCap;

// Display logic — only show "N/A" if truly missing
const display7d = change7d != null && change7d !== "" && change7d !== "N/A" 
    ? `${change7d > 0 ? '+' : ''}${typeof change7d === 'number' ? change7d.toFixed(2) : change7d}%`
    : null;  // Don't show "N/A", just hide the field

const displayFunding = fundingRate != null && fundingRate !== "" && fundingRate !== "N/A"
    ? `${(typeof fundingRate === 'number' ? (fundingRate * 100).toFixed(4) : fundingRate)}%`
    : null;

const displayOI = openInterest != null && openInterest !== ""
    ? formatLargeNumber(typeof openInterest === 'number' ? openInterest : parseFloat(openInterest))
    : null;
```

**Important**: If Claude outputs funding_rate as already formatted (e.g., "-0.29%"), don't multiply by 100 again. Check if it's a raw decimal (like 0.0029) or already a percentage string:
```javascript
function formatFundingDisplay(rate) {
    if (rate == null || rate === "" || rate === "N/A") return null;
    if (typeof rate === 'string' && rate.includes('%')) return rate; // Already formatted
    if (typeof rate === 'number') {
        if (Math.abs(rate) < 1) {
            // Raw rate like 0.0029 — multiply by 100
            return `${(rate * 100).toFixed(4)}%`;
        } else {
            // Already percentage like -0.29
            return `${rate.toFixed(4)}%`;
        }
    }
    return String(rate);
}
```

Also for the price display — if price is null or "N/A", don't show "N/A", just show the change percentage without a dollar amount:
```javascript
const displayPrice = price != null && price !== "" && price !== "N/A" && price !== 0
    ? `$${typeof price === 'number' ? price.toLocaleString() : price}`
    : null;  // Don't show N/A, just skip
```

### Testing
1. Click "Crypto" → X Sentiment section appears between Perps and Momentum Picks
2. X Sentiment shows BTC sentiment card with colored badge
3. X Sentiment shows social movers with velocity badges
4. X Sentiment shows narrative heat cards
5. If Grok data is unavailable, section doesn't appear (no empty section)
6. Momentum picks show funding rates (not "-") for OM, AXS etc.
7. Momentum picks show 7d change when available, hide field when unavailable (don't show "N/A")
8. Momentum picks don't show "N/A" for price — either show actual price or just show % change
9. All existing sections (BTC/ETH, Hot Categories, Perps, etc.) still render correctly
10. Top Perps by Volume table shows OI values
